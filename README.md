## What is this?! This isn't a JavaScript tutorial??
Greetings, if you were led here after searching GitHub repositories for a JavaScript tutorial, then I regret to inform you that this is not your answer. 

This is just a repository I made so that I can access the same files accross my desktop and laptop wherever I am and resume my JavaScript learning journey without inturruption.

This is also my first time using a GitHub repository for its intended purpose (on a private-scale level) so that is cool too.

[JavaScript overview guide](https://codexam.vercel.app/docs/js)
> _This guide seems to be a good resource for learning about JavaScript in general. It is not interactive like Hyperskill, but I still find it to be a good resource for simply learning about JavaScript and how it works or all of the different aspects to it._

[Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)
> _Hyperskill seems to be a great resource. It is structured and easy to do as little or as much as you want given your current time restraints. It has so many difference courses to choose from and projects to practice. I have been using the free version and haven't had any reason to upgrade so far._
