## What is this?! This isn't a JavaScript tutorial??
Greetings, if you were led here after searching GitHub repositories for a JavaScript tutorial, then I regret to inform you that this is not your answer. 

This is just a repository I made so that I can access the same files accross my desktop and laptop wherever I am and resume my JavaScript learning journey without inturruption.

This is also my first time using a GitHub repository for its intended purpose (on a private-scale level) so that is cool too.
